## Description

This program is a simple console-based game of "ConnectX", which is an extension of the regular Connect4 game that allows a user to enter how many tokens they need to get in a row to win the game, i.e. 3, 5, 6, etc.

The program can be run in the command line using the command "gradle runGame", assuming Gradle is installed.
